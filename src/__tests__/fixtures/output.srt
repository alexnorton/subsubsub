1
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,620
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,500
They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,170
This is madness.

4
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,640
We're doomed.

5
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,270
There'll be no escape for the princess this time.

6
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,070
What's that?

7
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,880
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,900
At last. Where have you been?

9
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,110
They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?

10
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,490
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines or smashed into who knows what.

11
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,700
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

12
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,510
The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,220
Where are those transmissions you intercepted?

14
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,140
What have you done with those plans?

15
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,220
We intercepted no transmissions.

16
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,190
This is a consular ship. We're on a diplomatic mission.

17
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,900
If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?

18
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,860
Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans!

19
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,910
And bring me the passengers! I want them alive!

20
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,920
There's one. Set for stun.

21
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,310
She'll be all right.

22
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,310
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

23
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,390
Hey. You're not permitted in there. It's restricted.

24
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,440
You'll be deactivated for sure.

25
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,030
Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease.

26
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,780
Come out, before somebody sees you.

27
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,370
Secret mission? What plans?

28
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,080
What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there.

29
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,670
I'm going to regret this.

30
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,130
- There goes another one. - Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

31
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,550
It must have short-circuited.

32
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,970
That's funny. The damage doesn't look as bad from out here.

33
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,310
Are you sure this thing is safe?

34
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,750
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

35
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,460
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic--

36
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,630
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

37
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,630
You weren't on any mercy mission this time.

38
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,840
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

39
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,810
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

40
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

41
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,020
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

42
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,980
You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.

43
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,020
Take her away!

44
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,860
Holding her is dangerous.

45
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,490
If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.

46
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,950
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

47
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,750
Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

48
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,750
She'll die before she'll tell you anything.

49
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,500
Leave that to me.

50
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,090
Send a distress signal, and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed.

51
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,300
Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship...

52
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,840
and no transmissions were made.

53
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,140
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life-forms were aboard.

54
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,230
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.

55
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,900
Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander.

56
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,060
There'll be no one to stop us this time.
