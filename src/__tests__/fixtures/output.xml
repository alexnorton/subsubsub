      <p id="p1" style="s0" begin="00:02:47.62" end="00:02:49.62">Did you hear that?</p>
      <p id="p2" style="s0" begin="00:02:49.71" end="00:02:52.50">They shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure.</p>
      <p id="p3" style="s0" begin="00:02:52.58" end="00:02:54.17">This is madness.</p>
      <p id="p4" style="s0" begin="00:03:04.18" end="00:03:05.64">We're doomed.</p>
      <p id="p5" style="s0" begin="00:03:08.02" end="00:03:10.27">There'll be no escape for the princess this time.</p>
      <p id="p6" style="s0" begin="00:03:13.61" end="00:03:15.07">What's that?</p>
      <p id="p7" style="s0" begin="00:04:57.38" end="00:04:59.88">R2-D2, where are you?</p>
      <p id="p8" style="s0" begin="00:05:16.44" end="00:05:18.90">At last. Where have you been?</p>
      <p id="p9" style="s0" begin="00:05:18.98" end="00:05:22.11">They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?</p>
      <p id="p10" style="s0" begin="00:05:22.19" end="00:05:25.49">We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines or smashed into who knows what.</p>
      <p id="p11" style="s0" begin="00:05:26.86" end="00:05:28.70">Wait a minute. Where are you going?</p>
      <p id="p12" style="s0" begin="00:05:41.46" end="00:05:44.51">The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.</p>
      <p id="p13" style="s0" begin="00:05:45.17" end="00:05:47.22">Where are those transmissions you intercepted?</p>
      <p id="p14" style="s0" begin="00:05:47.30" end="00:05:50.14">What have you done with those plans?</p>
      <p id="p15" style="s0" begin="00:05:50.22" end="00:05:52.22">We intercepted no transmissions.</p>
      <p id="p16" style="s0" begin="00:05:53.18" end="00:05:57.19">This is a consular ship. We're on a diplomatic mission.</p>
      <p id="p17" style="s0" begin="00:05:57.27" end="00:06:01.90">If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?</p>
      <p id="p18" style="s0" begin="00:06:05.32" end="00:06:08.86">Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans!</p>
      <p id="p19" style="s0" begin="00:06:08.95" end="00:06:11.91">And bring me the passengers! I want them alive!</p>
      <p id="p20" style="s0" begin="00:06:24.38" end="00:06:25.92">There's one. Set for stun.</p>
      <p id="p21" style="s0" begin="00:06:31.64" end="00:06:33.31">She'll be all right.</p>
      <p id="p22" style="s0" begin="00:06:33.39" end="00:06:35.31">Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.</p>
      <p id="p23" style="s0" begin="00:06:36.89" end="00:06:39.39">Hey. You're not permitted in there. It's restricted.</p>
      <p id="p24" style="s0" begin="00:06:39.48" end="00:06:41.44">You'll be deactivated for sure.</p>
      <p id="p25" style="s0" begin="00:06:43.40" end="00:06:46.03">Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease.</p>
      <p id="p26" style="s0" begin="00:06:46.11" end="00:06:47.78">Come out, before somebody sees you.</p>
      <p id="p27" style="s0" begin="00:06:50.16" end="00:06:52.37">Secret mission? What plans?</p>
      <p id="p28" style="s0" begin="00:06:52.45" end="00:06:55.08">What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there.</p>
      <p id="p29" style="s0" begin="00:06:58.41" end="00:07:00.67">I'm going to regret this.</p>
      <p id="p30" style="s0" begin="00:07:07.80" end="00:07:11.13">- There goes another one. - Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.</p>
      <p id="p31" style="s0" begin="00:07:11.22" end="00:07:12.55">It must have short-circuited.</p>
      <p id="p32" style="s0" begin="00:07:12.64" end="00:07:15.97">That's funny. The damage doesn't look as bad from out here.</p>
      <p id="p33" style="s0" begin="00:07:18.31" end="00:07:20.31">Are you sure this thing is safe?</p>
      <p id="p34" style="s0" begin="00:07:39.25" end="00:07:41.75">Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.</p>
      <p id="p35" style="s0" begin="00:07:41.83" end="00:07:45.46">The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this. When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic--</p>
      <p id="p36" style="s0" begin="00:07:45.54" end="00:07:47.63">Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.</p>
      <p id="p37" style="s0" begin="00:07:47.71" end="00:07:49.63">You weren't on any mercy mission this time.</p>
      <p id="p38" style="s0" begin="00:07:49.72" end="00:07:53.84">Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.</p>
      <p id="p39" style="s0" begin="00:07:53.93" end="00:07:56.81">I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
      <p id="p40" style="s0" begin="00:07:56.89" end="00:07:58.93">I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
      <p id="p41" style="s0" begin="00:07:59.02" end="00:08:02.02">I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.</p>
      <p id="p42" style="s0" begin="00:08:02.10" end="00:08:04.98">You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.</p>
      <p id="p43" style="s0" begin="00:08:05.06" end="00:08:07.02">Take her away!</p>
      <p id="p44" style="s0" begin="00:08:11.36" end="00:08:12.86">Holding her is dangerous.</p>
      <p id="p45" style="s0" begin="00:08:12.95" end="00:08:16.49">If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.</p>
      <p id="p46" style="s0" begin="00:08:16.58" end="00:08:18.95">I have traced the rebel spies to her.</p>
      <p id="p47" style="s0" begin="00:08:19.04" end="00:08:21.75">Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
      <p id="p48" style="s0" begin="00:08:21.83" end="00:08:23.75">She'll die before she'll tell you anything.</p>
      <p id="p49" style="s0" begin="00:08:23.83" end="00:08:25.50">Leave that to me.</p>
      <p id="p50" style="s0" begin="00:08:25.58" end="00:08:29.09">Send a distress signal, and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed.</p>
      <p id="p51" style="s0" begin="00:08:29.17" end="00:08:32.30">Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship...</p>
      <p id="p52" style="s0" begin="00:08:32.38" end="00:08:33.84">and no transmissions were made.</p>
      <p id="p53" style="s0" begin="00:08:33.93" end="00:08:38.14">An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life-forms were aboard.</p>
      <p id="p54" style="s0" begin="00:08:38.22" end="00:08:41.23">She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.</p>
      <p id="p55" style="s0" begin="00:08:41.31" end="00:08:44.90">Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander.</p>
      <p id="p56" style="s0" begin="00:08:44.98" end="00:08:47.06">There'll be no one to stop us this time.</p>
